	  	<p class="text-center">Developed in partnership with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) Office of Servicemember Affairs (OSA), this program is a result of needing to create an immersive interactive experience for low-bandwidth and mobile users. It’s an interactive graphic novel that follows the adventures of five delayed entry program (DEP) recruits. They are met with financial challenges that the user must solve all the while learning how to improve their own financial literacy.</p>
	  	<p class="text-center">As the project manager, I worked directly with the client to set project goals, create timelines and manage the overall creative process. I supervised a team of writers, illustrators, and developers. I was also the lead and only designer.</p>

  	  <p class="text-center">This is not your ordinary graphic novel. Through the use of animations-as-you-scroll (aka parallax), WILL’s branching storyline methods, and tailored financial tips and resources, users engage in a highly immersive experience on all devices and platforms.</p>
