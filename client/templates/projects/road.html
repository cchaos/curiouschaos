  		<p class="lead">The USDA Nation Organic Program (NOP)
  			needed a way to show and teach farm owners the process of becoming
  			Certified Organic and all the advantages that comes with the
  			certification. I focused on readability, ease-of-use, and
  			cross-browser compatibility and capitalized on the natural aspect of
  			the user’s daily life in the design of this interactive video.</p>

  		<p class="text-center">But I didn’t forget about the little
  			details like more information overlays and bookmarking features. The
  			transitions for the non-video screens were also tailored to have
  			movement to signify to the user fact-based and behavior-based feedback.</p>

  		<p class="text-center">Aside from just the typical choice, text,

  			favorite of which being the character menu. A lot of hours were
  			spent trying to figure out angles, make the transitions seamless,
  			and have the layout work in all sizes at all ratios.</p>
