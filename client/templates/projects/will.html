  	  <p class="lead">I started working at WILL in 2007, straight out of college. I was immediately tasked with creating a new logo for the company. Then in 2015, we once again decided to update the branding so it more cohesively exuded who WILL is. Just before leaving will in early 2016, we finalized the new logo. The broken arrow represents the multiple pathways through WILL's interactive storylines.</p>

      <p class="ideal text-center">The interesting part of seeing both logos side-by-side is that it not only shows the progression of how WILL has changed over the years, but how I as a designer have progressed in my skills and career.</p>

  	  <h3>Style Guide &amp; Documentation</h3>
  	  <p>To maintain this new brand throughout our custom applications, as a development team, we kept a living style guide with detailed documentation.</p>

	  	  <h3>Component-Based Development</h3>
	  	  <p>We built the more complex components as Ruby components and helpers for consistency and maintainability. The documentation would then show the resulting component, the code for ruby helper, and the resulting HTML.</p>
	  	  <p>To help with future iterations and implementation of the style guide, we maintained the components in a Ruby gem that could be used by all of our applications. This way, when we altered the HTML and CSS in one place they would update across all applications.</p>
