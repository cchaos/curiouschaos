	    <p class="lead">WILL Interactive is a creator of interactive training films. They realized that, from the 20+ years of film making, they were accumulating a large library of video snippets that could be utilized by other companies or individuals in their own training. My job was to take this concept of selling single and branching training scenarios and make it a reality in just under two months.</p>

  	  <h3>Personas</h3>
  	  <p>WILL employed a marketing company to conduct initial market research and potential user surveys. Based on these findings, we were able to group users into two categories â€“ individuals and publishers. Individual users are most likely HR professional who create their own training materials and are looking to supplement these with more engaging media. Publishers are companies who create and sell off-the-shelf training products and also want to find captivating media.</p>
