		<h4>MY PROCESS</h4>
		<p>I always start by <strong>identifying</strong> the client’s goals and the users’ needs. Finding where they intersect and the problem(s) to solve. Then I will brainstorm and <strong>strategize</strong> creative and intuitive solutions. I consider user stories and possible user flows. Always referencing back to the first step to make sure my concepts align. I start the <strong>creation</strong> process with wireframes and work up to high-fidelity mockups. I make sure the information is organized effectively and the interface design is compelling yet intuitive. If branding is needed I’ll start that here; creating logos, color schemes, etc. I <strong>implement</strong> the design utilizing progressive enhancement when using the newest technology. I make sure it’s mobile-<strong>friendly</strong> not just responsive. I also consider accessibility and backwards compatibility.</p>
